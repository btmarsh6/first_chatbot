# SQL Chatbot

This chatbot is designed to help query a SQL database using natural language. It is powered by OpenAI and Langchain and deployed on Streamlit.
The chatbot can be accessed [here](https://sqlchatbot-7cgyakbzywctnervmdtypi.streamlit.app/). In order to use the chatbot, you will need an [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api).

The repo contains a .sql file used to generate the sample Chinook database used in the bot.
